This scene from "Spirited Away" demonstrates as least 4 (maybe 5) of the animation principles:<br />

<br />

ANTICIPATION: The body language and downward glances of Chihiro (the little girl) effectively convey the height and vertigo-inducing quality of the staircase, despite it being drawn in 2 dimensions.<br />
<br />

FOLLOW-THROUGH: Looser parts of Chihiro - her hair and clothes - have greater and more independent motion than the rest of her body. Note how the wind affects them, and also what her hair does when she hits the wall after running down the stairs.<br />
<br />

SECONDARY ACTION: This principle is also used to heighten the drama of the scene - for example, the way Chihiro shifts her foot gingerly on a new step to test if it's secure, instead of just setting it down firmly.<br />
<br />

SOLID DRAWING: The feeling of height and exposure in this scene is also intensified by a strong sense of "volume and weight" conveyed through the drawing style. Contrast the brittle, rigid forms of the steps (including they way they splinter), with the realistically flimsy 3-D shapes of Chihiro's clothes and hair billowing in the wind.<br />
<br />

SLOW IN AND SLOW OUT: There are other clips with clearer demonstrations of this, but this scene certainly makes good use of sudden accelerations, with small touches to add a sense of physical forces (again, watch Chihiro's ponytail when she hits the wall).<br />

STAGING:<br />
<br />
Compare the reef in Finding Nemo...<br />

...to complexity of actual Great Barrier Reef:<br />

<br />
Simplified forms (no unnecessary detial) and more intense lighting and color are used to stage the scene and focus attention on the central characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
EXAGGERATION and <br />
APPEAL:<br />
<br />

While "Gollum" from the Lord of the Rings films is based on motion-capture of a very talented actor, animators dramtically exaggerated facial features, expressions and actions to give the character his unforgettable on-screen appeal:<br />

(Per Wikipedia: "A character who is appealing is not necessarily sympathetic – villains or monsters can also be appealing – the important thing is that the viewer feels the character is real and interesting.")
